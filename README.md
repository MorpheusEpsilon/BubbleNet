**Bubble Net**
What is Bubble Net?
Bubble Net is a prototype solution designed to help parents, tutors, and educators protect children (ages 5–15) while they explore the internet. It is not only about blocking harmful content but also about providing guidance, transparency, and education.
The interface shows a friendly onboarding, educational resources, and a simple allow/block system as a preview of how the system could work. But the real strength of Bubble Net is not in what you see.
**Why the backend is most important**
The frontend is just the surface, the smiling face that parents and kids interact with. The backend is where the actual protection, intelligence, and decision-making live.
The backend is in charge of privacy and safety. It decides what content is flagged, allowed, or blocked.
It is scalable and adaptable. The backend can expand rulesets, connect to multiple devices, and evolve as digital risks change.
It is designed for intelligent monitoring. While the prototype shows a simple allow/block, the backend can incorporate parental preferences, learning systems, and anonymization to make ethical and smart decisions.
A strong backend means the project is future-proof. Even if the interface changes, the protection system remains solid and ready to grow.
In short: the frontend is the introduction, but the backend is the actual guardian.
